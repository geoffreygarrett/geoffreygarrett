The satellite features two deployable panes, one side carrying solar cells, the other carrying the X-band radar antenna.\r\n\r\nThe StriX satellite constellation can target data with a ground resolution of 1-3 m, single polarized (VV), and a swath width of more than 10-30 km. The StriX observation modes are Stripmap and Sliding Spotlight mode and each satellite has an SAR antenna that is 5 meters in length and stowed during launch.
