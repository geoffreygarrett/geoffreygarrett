The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, or PSLV, climbed away from its firing stand on India\u2019s east coast at 8:32 a.m. EDT (1232 GMT) Thursday with more than a million pounds of thrust from its solid-fueled core stage. The Indian launcher flew in its \u201cCore Alone\u201d configuration without any strap-on solid rocket boosters, sending the three Singaporean payloads into a 354-mile-high (570-kilometer) orbit inclined 10 degrees to the equator. \u201cAll of the satellites were placed in the right orbit,\u201d said S. Somanath, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organization, India\u2019s space agency. The primary payload on the mission was the DS-EO satellite, a high-resolution Earth-imaging spacecraft developed by ST Engineering and Singapore\u2019s Defense Science and Technology Agency, the acquisitions and systems development division for the Singapore Armed Forces. The DS-EO satellite weighed about 804 pounds (365 kilograms) at launch.
