The three-stage rocket, topped by a Fregat upper stage, will take off from Vostochny, Russia\u2019s newest spaceport near the country\u2019s border with China in the far eastern Amur Oblast. The Soyuz will head north from the remote spaceport to target a near-polar orbit, using its Fregat upper stage to place the three Gonets data relay satellites into an orbit about 932 miles (1,500 kilometers) above Earth. Then the Fregat upper stage will fire its main engine multiple times to inject Russia\u2019s Skif-D tech demo satellite into a much higher orbit about 5,014 miles (8,070 kilometers) above Earth. The entire launch sequence will take several hours from liftoff until separation of the final satellite. Email the author.
