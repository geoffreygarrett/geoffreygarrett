The TARANIS microsatellite will fly over thousands of TLEs and TGFs for at least four years and will be capable of detecting these events and recording their luminous and radiative signatures at high resolution, as well as the electromagnetic perturbations they set off in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere. The payload includes numerous sensors to observe the TLEs and to perform in-situ measurements of perturbations caused on the local plasma (fields, waves and particles).", "launch_designator": null, "type": "Earth Science", "orbit": {"id": 17, "name": "Sun-Synchronous Orbit", "abbrev": "SSO"}}, "pad": {"id": 34, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/34/", "agency_id": 115, "name": "Ariane Launch Area 1", "info_url": null, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELA-1", "map_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/?q=5.239,-52.775", "latitude": "5.236", "longitude": "-52.775", "location": {"id": 13, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/13/", "name": "Kourou, French Guiana", "country_code": "GUF", "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/location_13_20200803142412.jpg", "total_launch_count": 315, "total_landing_count": 0}, "map_image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/pad_34_20200803143527.jpg", "total_launch_count": 47, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 47}, "webcast_live": true, "image": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launcher_images/vega_image_20201111143622.jpeg", "infographic": "https://spacelaunchnow-prod-east.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/launch_images/vega2520257c_infographic_20201116161633.png", "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6004, "location_launch_attempt_count": 302, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 43, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 289, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 93, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 5, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 2, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 7}], "expeditions": [], "spacestations": [], "program": []}, {"id": 615, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/event/615/", "slug": "artemis-i-candidate-landing-locations-teleconferen", "name": "Artemis I Candidate Landing Locations Teleconference", "updates": [], "type": {"id": 20, "name": "Press Event"}, "description": "NASA will hold a media briefing to announce the candidate landing locations for Artemis III -
