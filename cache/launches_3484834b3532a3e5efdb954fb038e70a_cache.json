The first-stage boosters and two core stages feature uprated engines with improved injection systems, compared to the previous versions of the Soyuz. Digital flight control and telemetry systems allow the rocket to be launched from a fixed launch platform, whereas the launch platforms for earlier Soyuz rockets had to be rotated as the rocket could not perform a roll to change its heading in flight.\r\n\r\nThe Soyuz 2.1b represents the latest development stage of the proven rocket.\r\n\r\nIt uses the new RD-0124 engines in the first three stages, coupled with an improved injection system that significantly boosts the performance of the Soyuz.\r\nFurthermore, she wears a new, digital startup control system.\r\nThis will allow the Soyuz 2.1b to carry around 1.2 tonnes more payload into low earth orbit compared to its predecessor.", "family": "Soyuz", "full_name": "Soyuz 2.1b Fregat", "manufacturer": {"id": 111, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/111/", "name": "Progress Rocket Space Center", "featured": false, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "RUS", "abbrev": "PRSC", "description": "Progress Rocket Space Centre, formerly known as TsSKB-Progress, is a space science and aerospace research company which is known for manufacturing launch vehicles and satellites.
