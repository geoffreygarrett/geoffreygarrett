The Electron Program was founded on the premise that small payloads such as CubeSats require dedicated small launch vehicles and flexibility not currently offered by traditional rocket systems. Its rocket, the Electron, is a light-weight rocket and is now operating commercially. Electron currently launches from only Mahia Peninsula in New Zealand however a second launch complex in the US is under development.", "administrator": "CEO: Peter Beck", "founding_year": "2006", "launchers": "Electron", "spacecraft": "", "launch_library_url": "https://launchlibrary.net/1.4/agency/147", "total_launch_count": 29, "consecutive_successful_launches": 9, "successful_launches": 26, "failed_launches": 3, "pending_launches": 11, "consecutive_successful_landings": 0, "successful_landings": 3, "failed_landings": 1, "attempted_landings": 4, "info_url": "http://www.rocketlabusa.com/", "wiki_url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab", "logo_url": "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/spacelaunchnow-prod-east/media/logo/rocket2520lab2520ltd_logo_20220218075411.png", "image_url": "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/spacelaunchnow-prod-east/media/agency_images/rocket2520lab2520ltd_image_20190207032456.jpeg", "nation_url": "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/spacelaunchnow-prod-east/media/agency_nation/rocket2520lab2520ltd_nation_20190207032456.png"}, "program": [], "variant": "", "alias": "", "min_stage": 2, "max_stage": 3, "length": 18.0, "diameter": 1.2, "maiden_flight": "2017-05-25", "launch_cost": "6000000", "launch_mass": 13, "leo_capacity": 300, "gto_capacity": null, "to_thrust": 162, "apogee": null, "vehicle_range": null, "image_url": "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/spacelaunchnow-prod-east/media/launcher_images/electron_image_20190705175640.jpeg", "info_url": "https://www.rocketlabusa.com/electron/", "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_\\(rocket\\)", "total_launch_count": 29, "consecutive_successful_launches": 9, "successful_launches": 26, "failed_launches": 3, "pending_launches": 11}, "launcher_stage": [], "spacecraft_stage": null}, "mission": {"id": 6124, "name": "The Owl Spreads Its Wings", "description": "Second of three launches of a StriX satellite as part of Synspective\u2019s SAR constellation.", "launch_designator": null, "type": "Earth Science", "orbit": {"id": 17, "name": "Sun-Synchronous Orbit", "abbrev": "SSO"}}, "pad": {"id": 65, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/pad/65/", "agency_id": 147, "name": "Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1A", "info_url": null, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Lab_Launch_Complex_1", "map_url": "https://www.google.com/maps/place/-39.262833,177.864469", "latitude": "-39.262833", "longitude": "177.864469", "location": {"id": 10, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/location/10/", "name": "Onenui Station, Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand", "country_code": "NZL", "map_image": "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/spacelaunchnow-prod-east/media/launch_images/location_10_20200803142509.jpg", "total_launch_count": 29, "total_landing_count": 4}, "map_image": "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/spacelaunchnow-prod-east/media/launch_images/pad_65_20200803143549.jpg", "total_launch_count": 26, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 26}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "image": "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/spacelaunchnow-prod-east/media/launcher_images/electron_image_20190705175640.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 6288, "location_launch_attempt_count": 30, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 27, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 30, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 125, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 7, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 4, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 7, "mission_patches": [{"id": 650, "name": "The Owl Spreads Its Wings Patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/spacelaunchnow-prod-east/media/mission_patch_images/the2520owl252_mission_patch_20220815204849.png", "agency": {"id": 147, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/147/", "name": "Rocket Lab Ltd", "type": "Commercial"}}]}]}
